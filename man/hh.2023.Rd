\description{  This data frame contains harvest information on all heads
  harvested from p1, p2, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, and tplot in 2024. There are a total of 920
  records. 
  This data frame was generated by the script 
  make.hh2023.R, which is saved in 
  ~Dropbox/CGData/140_reconcile/reconcile2023/reconcileWork.
  The records come from the reconciled harvest list in ~Dropbox/CGData/140_reconcile/reconcile2023/reconcileOut.
