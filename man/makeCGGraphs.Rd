\title{Write plots of characters for common garden experiments 1, 2, and 679}
\usage{
makeCGGraphs(mf, hf, yr, box.plot = FALSE, write.pdf = FALSE, write.path = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{mf}{path to the measure form for a given common garden experiment, generally in cgdata repo
(e.g. "summer2019/p1MeasureData/2019MeasureExPt1_2019-08-27.txt")}

\item{hf}{path to the head form for the same common garden experiment, generally in cgdata repo
(e.g. "summer2019/p1MeasureData/2019ExPt1HeadSubform_2019-09-27.txt")}

\item{yr}{the year the data in the input file was recorded (e.g. 2019, as above)}

\item{box.plot}{logical: if TRUE, makeCGGraphs will output boxplots of plant characters.
if FALSE, makeCGGraphs will output histograms of plant characters.}

\item{write.pdf}{logical: if TRUE, function will output a pdf that will save to write.path (good for printing!!!)
if FALSE, function will output the plots into the R viewer.}

\item{write.path}{path to the folder you want to output the write.pdfs to}
}
\description{
This function will take all data collected from a select common garden experiment
in a year and output summary plots - either boxplots or histograms - 
of the plant characters in that garden. Use it to diagnose any blatant data issues and
to print for folks to see the work they did!
}
\details{
function will not work if input fields are spelled or capitalized incorrectly. They must be:
bslLongLfCm, caulLongLfCm, bslLfCt, bslRosetteCt, flRosetteCt, (in mf) and headHeight (in hf). If they
are spellect incorrectly, read the .txt into R, rename files, and save it as a .csv.
p679 are 3 different plots in real life, but are treated as one by this function. They should also share a
Pendragon measuring form.
mf and hf are REQUIRED fields. If there are no head records for a plot (likely only in p679),
make an empty hf and input that.
