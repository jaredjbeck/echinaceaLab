## Useful R functions for Echinacea Project lab activities.

## Installation

You can install then use the **devtools** package to install the development version. Run this code:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("stuartWagenius/echinaceaLab")
library("echinaceaLab")
?echinaceaLab
```
Alternatively, you can download the [zip ball](https://github.com/stuartWagenius/echinaceaLab/zipball/master) and run `utils:::menuInstallLocal()` then `library(echinaceaLab)`. This works on Windows machines.

Mac users can download the [tar ball](https://github.com/stuartWagenius/echinaceaLab/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it.
